## Tools needed

This project is built using Visual Studio 2022 (Community).  
In addition to that, you'd need the following extensions:

- VSAE - Visual Studio Authoring Extensions
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Installer Projects

It *should* work with VS2017 and later, but this has not been tested.
